Vulnerability:       COSIGN-VULN-2007-003
Application:         cosign IIS filter
Affected Versions:   2.0.2 and previous
Vulnerability Type:  Transmission of unencrypted cookies
Severity:            High
Software Website:    http://weblogin.org/
Contact:             cosign@umich.edu
Dates:               2007-10-29 (discovered); 2007-11-08 (public disclosure)


DESCRIPTION
--------
Cosign is a web single sign-on system.  This vulnerability affects only the
IIS filter.

The IISCosign filter does not set cookies as secure.  After a user visits a
cosign-protected portion of an IIS filter, a service cookie that uniquely
identifies the user is set.  The service cookie is a string of randomly
generated, base64 characters.  While the cookie itself is sensitive, it does
not contain any user information within it.  Since the cookie is not flagged
as secure, any subsequent http requests, including those to http or non-
cosign-protected parts of a web site, will transmit the service cookie in
the clear.  This makes the cookie vulnerable to a replay attack.

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that Windows Servers running IISCosign immediately
are upgraded to version 2.0.3.  The default behavior for the 2.0.3 filter is
to flag cookies as secure.
