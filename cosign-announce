Hey all,

The Cosign Team is pleased to announce the 1.6.0 [ MD5 
a15eaa528433602e4a8c69c62898b77e ] release of cosign. Changelog at 
http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/software/cosign/changelog.txt, a brief bit 
on some key new features follows:

	CosignSiteEntry
a directive for the apache filter that allows the administrator to 
force users, upon successful authentication, to return to a specific 
URL ( this was formerly referred to as Top of Site policy and is now 
called "site entry".) Thanks to Mark Montague for the design.

	CosignHttpOnly
a directive that will allow cosign to protect non-SSL encrypted sites. 
The cookies will thus will no longer be marked secure, will be 
transmitted over http and will be eminently replay-able, but we have 
beeen asked for this feature, so it's there. All transactions with the 
cgi and cosignd will still be encrypted, just the transaction between 
the browser and the webserver will not.

	Support for n-tier cosign proxy authentication
The filter can now retrieve pre-registered proxy cookies so one web 
server can proxy the services of several others. Thanks to the folks at 
University of Edinburgh for their help on this one.

	Generic ( non UM ) HTML templates:
LOGIN_ERROR_HTML is now distinct from ERROR_HTML so specific login 
errors can all include login screen and fatal errors (where login is 
not possible) will not include a login screen. The files in 
cosign_src/html/ are login_error.m4 and error.m4 respectively.  This 
will require a change to your existing html if you are upgrading from a 
previous version.

Thanks also to Brett Lomas  at University of Auckland for several bug 
fixes and for helping us to make cosign configuration even more 
flexible.

As always, questions or comments are welcome to cosign@umich.edu Also, 
discussion is welcome at cosign-discussion@umich.edu

Cheers!

Subject: Using LDAP for AuthZ with Cosign's AuthN 
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 2004 17:13:22 -0400
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.618)

Hey all,

So, as you've all probably heard or read, Cosign was meant for 
Authentication only, and we've tried to isolate that as much as 
possible. But while Authentication is necessary, it if often not so 
useful without Authorization. And to that end, the cosign team has gone 
and appropriated mod_authz_ldap ( http://authzldap.othello.ch/ ) for 
LDAP group and role authorization. And I'm pleased to say it even 
works!

 From the download page on weblogin.org, you can now find:

	http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/downloads/mod_authz_ldap-NOTES.txt

[UMICH people - see 
http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/downloads/mod_authz_ldap-NOTES-UMICH.txt 
for umich specific settings ]

This is a how-to on building and configuring mod_authz_ldap to work 
with cosign ( or any other AuthN that populates REMOTE_USER ). These 
notes include a small patch that we have submitted to the author and 
will theoretically be included in the next release. So, if you're an 
early adopter, you're gonna need to patch for now. :)

Feel free to send questions or comments to cosign-discuss list!

-Johanna

Release Candidate 1 for IISCosign version 1.1.0 is now available.  We'd 
like to receive feedback, complaints, test reports, and bugs.  Please give 
this a spin and let us know what you think!  If there's anything we've left 
out or a promised or omitted feature you're waiting for, please let us know.

Previous versions available here:

--Jarod Malestein
--University of Michigan
--IT Central Services

Changes in IISCosign 1.1.0:

+ You can now specify allowUnauthenticatedAccess to <Protected/> pages.
Example:

<Protected allowUnauthenticatedAccess="TRUE">/MySweetWebApp</Protected>

What?  Yes, now you can have a folder or web page(s) that can be accessed 
by both logged in and non-logged in users.  If the user is logged in, the 
HTTP_REMOTE_USER, HTTP_REMOTE_REALM, and HTTP_COSIGN_SERVICE variables will 
be available.  If the user is not logged in, he is not redirected
and only the HTTP_COSIGN_SERVICE variable is available.

+ Log file locking issue circumvented.  This prevented multiple instances 
of the filter from being instantiated in IIS 6.0.  Unfortunately, multiple 
log files are not created.  This will be corrected.

+ <HttpsOnly /> option added. Default is TRUE. Set to FALSE to allow users 
to access cosign-protected pages without a secure connection. Example:

<HttpsOnly>FALSE</HttpsOnly>

+ Corrected bug that would protect something like "/studentsAndStaff" if 
"/students" was protected.  Then broke it, fixed it, broke it, fixed it. 
This is something you may want to double-check.

+ Extra info put into log file.  Please provide feedback on what you would 
and wouldn't like to have in the cosign log file.

+ Https redirect bug fixed.

+ Specifying web sites by their IIS description rather than DNS name is now 
an option.
Change your <Service /> tag as follows:

<Service IISDescription="IISCosign web site">cosign-service-name
...
</Service>

You can use either the original websitename item to refer to the DNS name 
or the new IISDescription. If both are present, IISCosign first looks for 
IISDescription and will ignore websitename.

For the curious parties, the "IISDescription" is compared to the 
ServerComment for the web site in the IIS metabase.

+ You can now limit the log file size. Change your <LogFilePath> to look 
like this:

<LogFilePath fileSizeInKB="4096">C:\Program 
Files\CosignFilter\Logs</LogFilePath>


What's on the roadmap (in no particular order):

- Creating multiple cosign log files when multiple instances of the filter 
are loaded.
- A logging level option.  Something like "normal/debug/trace."
- Implementing Apache-style on/off cosign protection mechanism.  This
would allow something like "/foo" to be protected and "/foo/bar" to be
unprotected.  As IISCosign stands now, "/foo", by default, will also
protect "/foo/bar".
- And, of course, rolling in contributions from other organizations.

Very important thing I forgot to mention: since this is a release candidate 
do not forget to backup your IISCosign folder!  In particular, the 
cosign.dll.config file and the contents of the /SSL folder!

X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.619)

The Cosign Team is pleased to announce the availability of version 
1.7.0 of cosign [ MD5 f4cece2c7b8b642c8135e90da7c4d422] .

Changelog at http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/software/cosign/changelog.txt

Changes:

	config: must specify path to apxs to build either filter, no default.
	common: first pass at rate logging, see README and man pages
	cgi: issue a new login cookie if the one presented is more than
		24 hours old.
	cgi: looping page a redirect now instead of just an error.
	cgi: check for sql injection prior to username query.
	cgi: less verbose logging, more sumamries.
	daemon: default log facility now daemon.
	daemon: more precise logging, supression of common errors.
	daemon/monster: override syslog facility and level from cmd line.
	filter: all settings configureable thorough runtime directives.
	filter: new directive to delimit authN optional, which allows you
		to push authN deicsions back into the application.
	filter: issue a new service cookie if the one presented is more than
		24 hours old.
	html: new looping page, a redirect from the cgi, will allow you to
		capture the browser info ( in access logs ) for clients
		who are looping.

Thanks to Phil Pishioneri from Penn State University for some minor bug 
fixes.

FYI: Cosign 1.8.0, which will mostly be Brett Lomas' (University of 
Auckland) changes to allow runtime configuration of the cgi and daemon 
from a single configuration file, will be released as soon as we get it 
reviewed and checked in. The only planned filter change is to allow 
CosignProtected On/Off in .htaccess files. Those of you who do not like 
to upgrade often and/or really want the runtime configuration for the 
cgi and daemon are advised to consider waiting.

IISCosign 1.1.1 is now availble for download from <http://weblogin.org>.

This is being called 1.1.1 instead of 1.1.0 since the versioning with 
InstallShield was slightly off.  Therefore, to make sure people are given 
the upgrade option with the installer and to avoid confusion, this one is 
being labeled 1.1.1.  It is highly recommended you upgrade as soon as 
possible, especially if you are on a pre-1.1.0 version, due to many useful 
bug fixes.

We are constantly refining and improving IISCosign and the installer.  If 
there are any recommendation or questions you have, please send them to 
cosign@umich.edu.

The next major item on the IISCosign roadmap is adding the Kerberos ticket 
passing functionality.

A list of the major changes since version 1.0.0 is below.

Happy upgrading!

--Jarod Malestein
--University of Michigan - ITCS



Changes in IISCosign 1.1.1:
+ Installer

Various, small fixes.

+ Some major IISCosign failures reported to the Event Viewer.

There is now a facility with IISCosign to report events directly to the
Event Viewer.  This is very useful for diagnosing problems, especially if
the log files cannot be created.  The events reported are not comprehensive
and will continue to be tweaked based on administrators' experience and
input.

+ You can now specify allowUnauthenticatedAccess to <Protected/pages.
Example:

<Protected allowPublicAccess="TRUE">/MySweetWebApp</Protected>

NOTE: this was previously labeled allowUnauthenticatedAccess.  For clarity
and parity with the Apache version, this has been changed to
allowPublicAccess.  Both will still work, but the former will, eventually,
be deprecated.

You can have a folder or web page(s) that can be accessed
by both logged in and non-logged in users.  If the user is logged in, the
HTTP_REMOTE_USER, HTTP_REMOTE_REALM, and HTTP_COSIGN_SERVICE variables
will be available.  If the user is not logged in, he is not redirected
and only the HTTP_COSIGN_SERVICE variable is available.

+ Log file locking issue circumvented.  This prevented multiple instances
of the filter from being instantiated in IIS 6.0.  Multiple log files are
created if possible.

+ <HttpsOnly /option added. Default is TRUE. Set to FALSE to allow
users to access cosign-protected pages without a secure connection.
Example:

<HttpsOnly>FALSE</HttpsOnly>

+ Corrected bug that would protect something like "/studentsAndStaff" if
"/students" was protected.  Then broke it, fixed it, broke it, fixed it.
This is something you may want to double-check.

+ Extra info put into log file.  Please provide feedback on what you
would and wouldn't like to have in the cosign log file.

+ Https redirect bug fixed.

+ Specifying web sites by their IIS description rather than DNS name is
now an option.
Change your <Service /tag as follows:

<Service IISDescription="IISCosign web site">cosign-service-name
...
</Service>

You can use either the original websitename item to refer to the DNS name
or the new IISDescription. If both are present, IISCosign first looks for
IISDescription and will ignore websitename.

For the curious parties, the "IISDescription" is compared to the
ServerComment for the web site in the IIS metabase.

+ You can now limit the log file size. Change your <LogFilePathto look
like this:

<LogFilePath fileSizeInKB="4096">C:\Program
Files\CosignFilter\Logs</LogFilePath>

Hey Jarod,

thanks for this, sounds good. We will start deploying this here ;)
Is the source for this version available at
http://cowboybebop.staff.itd.umich.edu/iiscosign/ ?? I tried to connect
before but was timing out.

Also, any idea on the date of the next release, as we would love the
kerberos stuff. In fact we need it for one of our applications. Is it
being developed now and in a state for us to test or not that far
advanced?

Thanks

Brett

I forgot to add this VERY IMPORTANT item to the announcement.  Certificate 
authority (CA) files need to be rehashed for IISCosign 1.1.1 to work 
properly.  The intention was to make this change for 1.1.2 or later to make 
upgrading more transparent, but... well, I forgot.  So now that 1.1.1 is 
out there, we can all start rehashing now.  It's very simple and 
Apache/Unix people have been doing this for years now.  That is, this is 
the 'right way' to work with CA files.

The main side effect of this is to receive a looping.html error page and to 
see a line such as error:14090086:lib(20):func(144):reason(134) in a cosign 
log file.

Here's how to rehash a CA file (umwebCA.pem in this case).  Openssl.exe is 
placed in your IISCosign directory upon install.

>From a command prompt run:

    openssl x509 -noout -hash -in \path\to\umwebCA.pem

A hash value is displayed.  Copy the contents of the \path\to\umwebCA.pem 
file into a file called <hash>.0

In your cosign.dll.config file have <CAFilePath> point to the folder where 
the has is located.  (Whereas in the past it would point directly to the 
file).

For those interested in the Kerberos 5 ticket-retrieving feature, it is now 
available for testing.  Many thanks to Mark Earnest at Penn State for 
writing this part of IISCosign!

<http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/software/cosign/download.html>

This is a dll only.  You will probably want to run the 1.1.1 installer 
before using 1.2.0 beta.

Add at least the following line to your cosign.dll.config file:

<GetKerberosTickets>FALSE</GetKerberosTickets>

If you want this set to TRUE you'll need:

<GetKerberosTickets>TRUE</GetKerberosTickets>
<KerberosTicketsPath>c:\Kerb5tkts</KerberosTickets>

With the TRUE setting you'll have a new server variable, HTTP_KRB5CCNAME. 
The value is set to FILE:[KerberosTicketsPath]\[TicketFile].  Please report 
any problems, concerns, or successes to cosign@umich.edu.

Just a point of clarification, Allen Cheung actually wrote most of it.

The Cosign Team is pleased to announce the availability of version 
1.8.0 of cosign  [ MD5 64a025b4dc1de31a3cd2ff59cf086c1e ]

Changelog at http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/software/cosign/changelog.txt

Changes:
	updates to READMES
	config: make install rule works from top level Makefile for apache 2.
	common: cgi and daemon can both read several config options from
                 the cosign.conf file, see README and man pages. Many 
thanks
                 to Brett Lomas at University of Auckland.
	common: TCP_NODELAY on by default in daemon, filters, and cgi,
                 and off by default in monster. This should cause a
                 noticeable improvement in replication and a small
                 improvement in the cgis & filters.
	cgi: basiccosign.cgi and cosign.cgi are now 1 cgi. BasicAuth support
                 is now implicitly built-in.
	cgi: massive code re-structure.
	cgi: subfile() now shared across both cgis (cosign.cgi and logout)
	cgi: filters can now optionally include (or not) a semi-colon at
                 the end of the cookie when they re-direct for a 
register.
                 The cgi can parse both ways.
	cgi: if logout is unable to run, we now tell the user to quit
                 their browser instead.
	daemon/monster: code clean-up and small re-organization.
	daemon/monster: renamed some variables for clarity.
	daemon: fixed bug where a timed-out child was giving a 4xx,
                 causing filters to set unnecessary new cookies and 
re-register.
	daemon: fixed bug in hup() and child() signal handlers (removed
		possibly non-reentrant calls)
	filters: fixed bug with PostErrorRedirect - it works, now.
	filters: logging now using ap_log_error() so it's more syslog-esque.
	filters: fixed bug in apache2 where building with krb and then not
		getting tickets would cause garbage to be written into the
		cookie file, and the server to core dump.
	filters: specifically apache2, fixed misc build errors.

Thanks to Brian Hatch for minor bug fixes, and Brett Lomas from U of 
Auckland for all of the runtime configuration work.

Changelog at http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/software/cosign/changelog.txt

	updates to READMES
	common: updated config.sub and config.guess.
	cgi: looping page can be autoconfed or set within the config file.
	cgi: MAX_KEYTAB_NAME_LEN defined inline if not already done.
	cgi: NULL keytab means KDC check won't get run.
	cgi: On Macs, TGTs won't get passed to the daemon as they don't
		reside in the filesystem but rather
		somewhere in memory a la Apple's Kerberos Cache API.
	cgi/filters: return codes from talking to the daemon are now
		#defined and simplified, to make the code more readable.
	cgi/filters: we now deal with a mix of 4xx and 5xx answers correctly
	daemon: updated man pages to reflect required ticket argument
		in cosign.conf syntax.
	filters: CosignProtected On/Off allowed in .htaccess files now.
	filters: moved around some authN/authZ decisions so "require",
		"order", and "satisfy" work better. It's still not perfect,
		but that's an Apache issue, we just work with what we have.
	filters: We now return PostErrorRedirect earlier.

We're all terribly proud of Wes and Jo's work and extend them the  
sincerest congratulations.  Jarod and I will be taking a more active  
role in shepherding Cosign while they concentrate on overseeing and  
maintaining their new release during her first few months.

The Cosign Team is pleased to announce the availability of version  
1.9.0 of cosign [ MD5 2ec240c09951b17babe60a06d7941ad6 ]

Changelog at http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/software/cosign/changelog.txt

     updates to READMES
     more streamlined single server trial install process.
     common: added double quote support to argcargv() parsing.
     cgi: override "found" Kerberos paths.
     cgi: template directory configurable from cosign.conf.
     cgi: login and transfer tickets with x509.
     cgi: added ability to force re-authentication on a  per-service  
basis.
     cgi: tgts are transfered on macs again, we just build with MIT  
kerberos instead of on-board kerberos.
     cgi: check length of username before copy.
     cgi/daemon: ticket stores are separable.
     cgi/daemon: fixed miscellaneous core dump causing bugs.
     filters: streamlined server/directory directive merge routines.
     filters: almost all directives can be set on a per directory basis.
     filters: multiple CosignSiteEntry behavior more consistent.
     friend: cosign-friend is now its own project, which means it is  
no longer a part of this distribution.
     libsnet: updated to current version.
     templates: default action is now "/cosign-bin/cosign.cgi"  
instead of "/". Details on suggested Apache configurations are  
available in README.weblogin.
     scripts: fixed syntax error in helloCosign.php

For those who don't know yet, U-M has deployed a new version of the Friend guest
account system.  The two largest additions to the system are the addition of
user- and web-app-initiated mass invites.  While the end-user interface is
available -- https://friend.weblogin.umich.edu/friend/invite/ -- we, the CoSign
team, would like to work closely with a couple (few?) units on campus to create
pilot XML-RPC-enabled Friend services.

If you are interested in adding this functionality to any of your cosign-enabled
web apps, please let us know as soon as possible!

Hi All,
 
We have setup the java filter on Tomcat with ssl implemented.  I know next to nothing about java or Tomcat.  The filter seems to be working fine, however, the local logout is not expiring the cookie.  The tomcat server uses the same url, just a different port number.
 
Any ideas would be appreciated.
 
thanks
 
jim

Hey all,

Due to an extremely small but critical misstep in the new filters/ 
common Makefile(.in), I present you cosign 1.9.2 ( MD5  
f75856d915e8c518c81b8ab70c48b7d7 )

It's got all the same yummy new goodness as 1.9.1, and will also  
build an apache filter that will transfer tickets. Thanks to Graeme  
Wood at University of Edinburgh for catching this. Which also brings  
me to my next question - anyone willing to test release candidates  
for us? I prefer to get things right the first time, and an extra  
pair of eyes is always helpful. Send me mail if you're interested and  
willing.

Thanks, and have a happy holiday for those of you who are celebrating  
tomorrow.

-Johanna, and the rest of the Cosign dev team

Hey all,

The Cosign Team is pleased to announce the availability of version

Changelog at http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/software/cosign/changelog.txt

The main change is a bug fix to the way cosignd ( with replication  
turned on ) handles the HUP signal.

This is also the last planned release, feature-wise, in the 1.9  
branch. We are beginning work on the first 2.0 release, which will  
contain support for multi-factor authentication.

Questions and Comments always welcome.

The Cosign Team is pleased to announce the availability of version  
1.9.4 of cosign [ MD5 2b375ca7acf7b3e6e435e3c47441b7cf ].

Changelog at http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/software/cosign/changelog.txt

This is merely a bug fix release, with a small change to the daemon's  
replication when dbhashing is turned on, and a cosmetic fix to the  
make install rule for the filters.

X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.749.3)

The Cosign Team is pleased to announce the availability of the first  
BETA release Cosign 2.0!

Cosign 2.0.0b1 [ MD5 22076feda618edb31a3aeecb9537081c ]

Changes in this release include a new version of the cosign protocol,  
the addition of Multifactor authentication, and the new external  
authenticator API for the CGI. A full detail of changes is available at
http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/software/cosign/changelog.txt

Things we have yet to test in depth:

1) replication with multiple factors/the v2 protocol
2) anything under any sort of load
3) extensive compatibility tests**
4) building with no legacy factors ( no krb and no friend ) and using  
only an external authenticator
5) upgrading a production server, or any server with existing logged  
in users

This new release is up for download at http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/ 
software/cosign/download.html

We're going to keep testing it here at Michigan and plan to be  
rolling it out within the next month. Feedback is encouraged and  
welcomed as always.

-Johanna and the Core Cosign Development Team

**it should all just work, and we've tried several old/new combos  
upgraded server and older filters, upgraded filters and old server,  
upgraded server and older cgi... but nothing extensive. the 2.0 CGI  
requires a 2.0 cosignd.

MD5 52812510d864f23db92508491ccedb8a


Changes:
+ Multi-factor support
+ SiteEntry config option added
+ PostErrorRedirect config option added
+ CheckIPAddress options are now never, intial, or always
+ Apache-style protected/unprotected/protected configuration.  For 
example, you can have "/subdir" protected and then set 
"/subdir/notimportant" to unprotected.
+ Updated logging messages.

To use multi-factor, you need a 2.0.0+ Cosign login server.  IISCosign 
2.0.0 is backwards compatible with earlier versions of cosign.

There are some significant changes to the cosign.dll.config file.   
Please see the included sample config file!

Please send any questions or comments to cosign@umich.edu.

Hi All,
 
I need to redirect all logins to an entry site.  While I see this option in the Apache filter, I do not see it in the IIS or the Java filter.  Here is the Apache
 
CosignSiteEntry         [ the URL to redirect to after login  ]
 
Is this option available in the java and IIS filters?  If so, could you send me the syntax?  If not, anyone got any ideas?  Also, is the desired location that the user originally was trying to access available to a cgi script?  Some users will be forwarded while others will have to stop at the site entry.
 
I looked at the authentication factor, but this will not help me.  Basically, I have to setup a checkin script for students that comes up first if they don't have certain requirements met.  It also needs to work from IIS, Apache or Java apps.  Cosign seems the perfect place to implement this.
 
Thanks much,
 
jim

The changes are pretty minor, but important in our environment -  
especially the cgi one, as we're going through a big "change your

	cgi: preauth failed and expired password are now re-tryable errors
	daemon: krbtktpath is now maintained upon subsequent logins
	filters: fixed some typos

Version 2.0.0 of IISCoSign is now available for download from 
http://weblogin.org

Besides multi-factor support, the biggest change is the new schema for 
the cosign.dll.config files.  Included in the zip file is a sample 
config file with an explanation of the new layout.

Here is a list of changes from the last official release, 1.1.1:

1.2.0
+ Kerberos ticket retrieving -- IISCoSign can now retrieve and store 
Kerberos 5 tickets (if allowed by the weblogin server).
+ Load failure mode -- If an occurs while IISCoSign is loading or 
verifying a user, it will prevent the web site from serving content.

1.5.0 -
+ Multi-factor authentication support -- Support for other 
authentication methods.  The authentication factors are made available 
through the server variable HTTP_COSIGN_FACTORS.
+ Validating config file independent of loading filter, xml schema for 
config file. -- The filter now verifies the config file against a schema 
and reports any misconfiguration information to the Event Viewer.

2.0.0 -
+ Apache style protected/unprotected/protected configuration -- There 
are now three directives for a URL: <Protected>, <AllowPublicAccess>, 
and <Unprotected>.  <Unprotected> is used to override an earlier 
<Protected> or <AllowPublicAccess> tag.  So, for example: /a could be 
protected, but /a/b could be unprotected.

+ SiteEntry support -- When a user logs in for the first time, this 
option will redirect the user to the specified 'splash' or 'main menu' 
page of your web app.
+ PostErrorRedirect support -- If a user is redirected to a weblogin 
server and he was POSTing, the user is redirected to this warning page 
to let them know there will be lost data.

Finally, thanks to everyone who helped test the 2.0.0 beta!

Please send comments or questions to cosign@umich.edu or 
cosign.discuss@umich.edu.

The cosign-announce e-mail list has moved!  Please subscribe to the new 
list at:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cosign-announce

Please do not send any e-mail to the old, umich.edu address.

cosign-discuss will be moving, too.  You should have received separate 
e-mail about that.

cosign@umich.edu is still available for contacting the core developers and for
exceedingly umich-specific issues.
